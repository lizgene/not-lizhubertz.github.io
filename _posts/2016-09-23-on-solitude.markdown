I often play back memories that warn me not to be alone.  

_What did solitude ever do but leave you broken? Don’t you remember those days? Those long nights that turned to days that lingered long into hazy nights like days?_  

It felt endless.  

But things are different now. I am my own, unlike who I was then. I rest comfortably in my glasses, my dressed-down clothes undone but clean. I write my words and play my songs, the same as always yet by a softened quality of light.  

It’s been a long time since I asked someone to validate who I am. A long time since I inhaled the smoke of a whispered _yes, you exist, and you are good_.  

I first came to know the shape of my body against that air, afraid to peek out and see for myself the world as it was.  

What was I afraid I might find?  

As I look around now, I see above all that I am human, and that by itself is a spectacular creative wonder.
