This moment was one of those rare flowers of life that blooms but once a season, never two just the same. Captivating and full of promise as it grows, radiant in its summer. Softly and sweetly forlorn as fall turns to winter.  

My life is a collection of these moments, and so is yours. We keep them with us, pressed and given a place of highest honour on the mantles of our hearts, like my mother keeps her mother’s flower close and her father’s now beside her.   

These places and events in time were observed and so always have been, and always will be, there. And for those who stood witness, each one a beautiful memory.  

And for every one I must accept and fully experience loss in its turn, knowing that I, too, sprout seeds that will someday sit on the cherished mantle of the hearts of those I love.   

And it is sad. It is sad when those moments have passed. It is sad to see something that has graced the universe with such spectacular light burn down, as it must, to a glow, and shift its yellows and golds to the soft cooling warmth of orange, red, blue and purple.  

To mourn these moments is natural, to let them rest a necessity, and to cherish them a kindness.  

So to each I say thank you, I honor you. Rest now and be free.
