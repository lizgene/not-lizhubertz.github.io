I built for myself a little box  
made of glass, paper and string  
when I'm inside no one can see me  
when they ask "who's there?" no one will be  

I sit inside my box and wonder  
writing letters, sketching with pen  
flowing thoughts, dreams and distractions  
when done, through the mailbox they'll send  

and when you ask "where did this come from?"  
"nowhere" is all that I'll share  
for I know in my heart that to answer  
would change this space I hold so dear
