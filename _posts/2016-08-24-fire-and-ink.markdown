oh mother of mine  
it stole  
your self.

oh, but you’ve felt it!  
you _feel_ it  
as I do  

that hot pool of ink  
seeping, seething  
sinister and steaming  

it reflects me  
as it reflects you  
it was given to me   
as to you  
and you taught me to survive  
as your mother taught you

_hush now, little girl  
don’t cry  
here, a cool compress  
to calm the fire_
